The rubric seems really general to us, so we aren't too sure as to what types of questions will be asked. There is a lot involved and each App varies in functionality and design, especially for backend code. Will the judges base it on the app itself, or wil they be comparing it to previous presentations. Also, for programming will they ask technical details like model types or just general programming questions?
