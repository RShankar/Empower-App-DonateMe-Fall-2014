Project Assignment 1

This is a group-level project assignment. Decide on the App ASAP, contact Ms Iris Minor to visit the school and talk to the teachers and students (in the middle school afterschool program) - and decide on the content for your App. Develop a storyboard - using Balsamiq (I have given you access to FAU's account - try and let me know if there are any issues) and present it to class on 10/17. Submit your Balsamiq as one file. You also can post the file (not the link) at your Confluence site and just give me the link to your Confluence posting as your submission at Blackboard.  Ask Ahmed if you need to know anything about Confluence. You will be arranging all your submissions just like the high school students did. For a few good examples, see the postings of Groups 8,6, 1, and 7 - they were the top teams this summer.

Contact Info for Ms. Minor: Minor, Iris [IrMinor@mhs.net], GlufStream Middle School, Hallandale, FL.

School Info: 120 SW 4th Ave. Hallandale Beach, Florida 33009 • Office: 754-323-4700 • Fax: 754-323-4785, http://www.gulfstreammiddle.com/

This is old info: I have contacted Ms. Minor. I would like to propose that we all go to the middle school this Friday afternoon and meet the teachers and students. There will be no class lecture on Friday to facilitate this.





Project Assignment 2


Submit this at Github under 'Progress Report 1'. Submit link to this file at BB (one submission per group).  Update your mockups based on your discussion with middle school students last week. and attach to this file.  Explain in the edit section (the text file) what the mockups do not adequately describe.

Also, Answer the following questions in the text file (briefly):

(1) What will be in Processing (the part that can be customized) and what will be in Java? If you wish, identify this on the mockup screens and indicate here textually which ones wil be done in which part of the App.

(2) What are the empowerment/customizability aspects that you are providing the middle school students (next summer, when I teach them Processing so they can go and cusotmize the code)? Which member of your team is responsible for this separation? This person will also be responsible for the Processing part of the App.

(3) What assets (graphics, music, animation) are being planned for your App? List them. Who will do them in your group? If you need help from Prof. McAfee or his students, list clearly what you want. I will give them the links to Github so they can see what you are seeking. They will send them to you and you can upload them to the site. Or. they can post them at their Github site and  you can 'copy' them over. Which team member is reponsbile for this communication and build up of assets? This person also will be responsible for the UI parts built in  XML.

(4) The other member (please idenfity here) will be responsible for the Java code. This may include sections on parse.com, Wifi, LBS, maps, Bluetooth, data analytics, etc. Some such as LBS, Wifi, and Bluetooth may also be incorporated at the Processing level.

If the separation of duties is different in your group, please let me know (through this post at Github) how you have decided to divide up the work. If a student is not participating actively in the project, others will have to pitch in and make sure that aspect is addressed at least minimally. I will make up a submission at semester end that will seek your feedback on how each member in the group contributed.
